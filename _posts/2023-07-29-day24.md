Hi,today was my 24th day training at ryaz.io 

### Tasks done
* Learned more about AOS library
* Learned about Zoom in ,Zoom-out , Fade-up ,Fade-down
* Fixed an error in TODO App(when i was clicking on completed task again count was decreasing so i deal with it by using css propery )
```css
.class{
pointer-events:none
};
```
* I will be checking and improving the TODO App
