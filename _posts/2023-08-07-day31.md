Hi,today was my 31st day training at ryaz.io
## Tasks done
* Today, I worked on Javascript Code repitition.
* I wasn't able to solve the code repitition till 4 hours.
* Then my mentor suggested me a solution and that worked on me.
* Fun fact is ,700+ lines are deleted and functionality remains same.
* Today i learned about Code Optimisation.
