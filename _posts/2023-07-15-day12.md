Hi,today was my 12th day training at ryaz.io 
Today,I was little bit busy due to some family matter so i am not able to work as effective as before .Will try to work effectively and consistently from next days
* Tasks done
* Coded apple watch template=> A template designed in figma(editing software) and i am trying to clone that piece of template 
* Faced issues like viewport(vh,vw) but later solved them with the help of google.
* In this template i have used relative units like rem,em. Earlier, I was using absolute units like px which give the problem while giving responsive nature to the website.
* Responsiveness is pending but will complete it ASAP!
